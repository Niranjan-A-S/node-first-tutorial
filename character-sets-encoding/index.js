//!Character Sets
//Character Sets are predefined list of characters represented by numbers
//Popular Character Sets are Unicode and ASCII
//Unicode determines V should be represented as 86

//!Character Encoding
//Character Encoding dictates how to represent a number in a character set as binary data before it can be stored inside the computer
//It dictates how many bits are used to represent the number
//Example of a character encoding is UTF-8
//UTF-8 states that the character should be encoded in bytes (8 bits)
//Eight 1s or 0s should be used to represent code of any character in binary
//4 => 100 => 00000100
